 * The Dialog object allows you to display dialogs that prompt the user for confirmation, allow them to input text strings or passwords, and select checkbox options or choose from a drop-down list. You can also use this object to display a popup menu on screen.
 *
 * You can create a Dialog object from the DOpus.Dlg, Lister.Dlg, Tab.Dlg, Func.Dlg and Command.Dlg methods.
 *
 * See the Example Scripts section for an example of its use.
 *
 * There are two different ways to use the Dialog object. You can either:
 *
 * * Use the one-shot methods ( Folder , GetString , Multi , Open , Request or Save ) to display a simple dialog of various types, or
 *
 * * Configure the dialog first by setting the values of the various properties, and then call the Show function to display it. This method also lets you create and use script dialogs .
 *
 * The one-shot methods accept several parameters but are generally not as flexible as building up the dialog and then calling Show .

	 * Specifies the buttons that are displayed at the bottom of the dialog. These buttons are used to close the dialog. The Show method returns a value indicating which button was chosen (and this value is also available in the result property).
	 *
	 * Multiple button strings must be separated with vertical bar characters (|). If a button has more than one button then by definition the last one is the "cancel" button. For example:
	 * ```javascript
	 * dlg.buttons = "OK|Retry|Cancel"
	 * ```
	 *
	 * To specify accelerators for the buttons prefix the desired key with an ampersand (&) character. For example:
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * dlg.buttons = "&OK|&Retry|&Cancel"

	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * dlg.buttons = "OK|Retry+Retry All|Cancel"
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Within drop-down menus, you can specify that certain menu items can be accessed directly from the main button by holding Shift, Ctrl or Shift+Ctrl. This is done by adding an equals sign (=) and then the label the button should display when the key is held down (usually an abbreviated version of the menu item label, or a repetition of the label itself if it is already short enough). The keys are automatically assigned and you can only do this for at most three items. For example:

For example, you might specify id as "kundal" - Opus would then internally save these variables for a dialog called "dialog1" as "kundal!dialog1".

	/**
	 * Allows a script dialog to monitor events in a folder tab. You will receive notifications of the requested events through your message loop.
	 *
	 * The tab parameter specifies the Tab you want to watch. The events string is a comma-separated list of events you want to watch for. The id string is an optional parameter; it lets you assign your own ID to the tab to make it easier to tell where events are coming from (if you're monitoring multiple tabs, for instance).
	 *
	 * These are the events you can watch for are. Note that some are equivalent to the existing script events (e.g. OnActivateTab):
	 *
	 * * **select** - items in the tab are selected or deselected
	 * * **navigate** - the folder is changed in the tab
	 * * **add** - items are added to the folder
	 * * **delete** - items are deleted from the folder
	 * * **change** - items in the folder are changed (size, date, name, etc)
	 * * **activate** - tab activated or deactivated
	 * * **srcdst** - source/destination state changed
	 * * **view** - view mode changed
	 * * **flat** - flat view state changed
	 *
	 * Once notification has been established you will be notified of all requested events when they occur. Note that no specific information is sent with notifications - e.g. for the "change" event, you aren't told which items have changed, only that something has.
	 *
	 * You will receive notification events in your message loop. The various properties of the Msg object let you determine what happened.
	 *
	 * The Msg.event property will be set to tab for notifications from a watched folder tab.
	 *
	 * The Msg.control property tells you which tab the change occurred in; if you specified an ID when you called the WatchTab function, this will be in the Msg.control property - otherwise, it will be the numeric handle of the tab. Note that it's *not* the actual Tab object. You can access the Tab object via the Msg.tab property but this can be inefficient, as it requires a new Tab object to be created every time. If you're only monitoring one tab it's better to store the Tab object in your own variable - and if you're monitoring multiple tabs you could, e.g. use a unique ID for each one and keep the objects in a Map.
	 *
	 * The Msg.value property tells you which notification event occurred. Possible values are select, navigate, filechange, activate, srcdst, view, flat, and close (sent if the tab is closed while you are monitoring it).
	 *
	 * For the filechange event, the Msg.data property contains a bit mask indicating which file events occurred. 1 = add, 2 = delete, 4 = change. The values will be added together (so e.g. 6 indicates at least one item was changed and at least one was deleted). It's up to your script to determine exactly what changed.
	 *
	 * You can change the events you're monitoring for by calling the WatchTab method again with the same tab and new event list.
	 *
	 * To stop monitoring an existing tab, call WatchTab with the second parameter set to stop. Monitoring is automatically cancelled if your dialog closes (and also if the tab closes).

	 * * **d** - delete-on-close. The file will be automatically deleted when closed.
	 *
	 * When using write mode, you may add **f (force)** to any of the above mode strings to tell Opus to clear the read-only file attribute if it blocks modifying an existing file; otherwise, attempting to open a read-only file for writing will fail.

 * ```count: 4
 * bird -> tweet
 * cat -> meow
 * dog -> woof
 * snake -> hiss
 * ```
 *

 * ```javascript
 * var map = DOpus.Create.Map();

 * map("cat") = "meow";
 * map("dog") = "woof";
 * map("bird") = "tweet";

 * DOpus.Output("count: " + map.count);

 *   // CY - JS-conform usage: var value = map.get(key);
 *   var value = map(key);
 *   DOpus.Output(key + " -> " + value);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * VBScript Example:
 * ```vbscript
 * Dim map, key, value
 * Set map = DOpus.Create.Map
 * map("cat") = "meow"
 * map("dog") = "woof"
 * map("bird") = "tweet"
 * map("snake") = "hiss"

	 * If the ScriptColumn.multicol value is set to True when the column is added, then this property provides a Map that lets you return the values of one or more columns at once.
	 *
	 * You may want to use this method if your script returns multiple columns that all share common calculations (e.g. reading the contents of a folder). That way, you can avoid repeating potentially time consuming operations when you're called for the second and subsequent columns.
	 *
	 * The Map contains one member element for each of your columns. Each member element has **group, group_type, sort, type, userdata,** and **value** properties which are equivalent to the ones described below.
	 *
	 * For example, you might set the value of a column called MyColumn like this:
	 *
	 * `scriptColData.columns("MyColumn").value = "My Column Value";`
	 *
	 * You should check if a column exists in the map before populating data for it. In some situations, Opus will only request a some of the columns your add-in supports, not all of them.
	 *
	 * If you do not fill in data for a column which Opus still needs, Opus will call your method again to request it, with its name in the col property (but still in multi-column mode). You can take advantage of this if calculating one piece of data yields values for some of your columns but not all of them. You do not need to populate every column if you the data is not available, but you should at least populate the col column.
	 *
	 * As a consequence of the above, when using multi-column mode you should always set some kind of value for any column you have spent time calculating, even if the result of the calculation is that nothing should be shown in the column. If nothing should be shown, set the value to an empty string (this is fine even if the column normally displays numbers or another type of data). If you don't set any value at all, Opus will assume you haven't calculated that column yet and may call your script again to ask for it, which could cause you to waste time re-calculating it when you already know it is blank.
